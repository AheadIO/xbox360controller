# xbox360controller

[![PyPI Version][pypi-image]][pypi-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Code Health][landscape-image]][landscape-url]

This Python Package aims to provide a pythonic and complete API for your Xbox360 and similar game controllers.
Currently it's built on top of the Linux kernel driver `xpad` so you can use it on almost any Linux distribution including your Rasperry Pi projects etc.

The following features are supported:

- Registering callbacks for **all** Buttons and Axes, Triggers and Hat in a `gpiozero`-inspired way

- Setting the LED circle; all `xpad` provided options are possible: blinking, rotating, setting individual LEDs on and off, ...

- Rumbling, both the left and right side can be controlled from 0 to 100 percent

## Installation

Any Linux distribution:

```
pip3 install -U xbox360controller
```

You might also use a _virtual environment_, or do a per-user install by providing the `--user` flag to above command.
Global installations might require the usage of `sudo` or working directly from a root shell but are **not recommended**.

If the `pip3` command cannot be found, try `pip` or make sure to have pip installed properly:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
